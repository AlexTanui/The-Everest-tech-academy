 		 	  	    		<p>Web services are software components that are designed to communicate with each other over a network. They enable applications to interact with each other regardless of the programming language, operating system, or hardware platform that they are built on.

								Web services typically follow a standardized set of protocols for exchanging data, such as SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol), REST (Representational State Transfer), or XML-RPC (Remote Procedure Call). These protocols define how data is transferred between the client and server applications, and how the client application can call methods on the server application to retrieve or modify data.</p>
